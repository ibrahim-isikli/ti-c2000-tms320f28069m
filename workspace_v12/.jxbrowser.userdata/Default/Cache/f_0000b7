    "overviewDescription": "MSP430FR5xx/6xx 16-bit Microcontrollers Series feature embedded FRAM and are based on the lowest power MCU technology platform. While also featuring FRAM for faster, lower power writes in a unified non-volatile memory, these devices are the lowest power MCUs ever with 100uA/MHz active power, 500nA standby with RTC, and 75uA ADC.  Devices operate up to 16 MHz and are ideal for wireless, medical, metering, and sensing applications.",
