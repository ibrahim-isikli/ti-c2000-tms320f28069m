# TI C2000 – TMS320F28069M Workspace (CCS v12)

This repository contains my old **Code Composer Studio v12 workspace** for the **TI C2000 TMS320F28069M** MCU.  
It includes a collection of small example projects and lab-style experiments I used while learning the device and its peripherals.

## 🛠 Requirements

To build and run these projects you typically need:

- **Code Composer Studio v12** (or a compatible version)
- **C2000Ware** or old **controlSUITE** device support for **TMS320F28069M**
- A compatible **TMS320F28069M LaunchPad / controlCARD** or custom board

If you open the workspace with a newer CCS version, it may ask you to:

1. **Migrate the projects** to the new compiler / device support,
2. Fix any missing paths to C2000Ware / headers / linker command files.
